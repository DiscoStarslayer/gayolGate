! APKMirror is a highly curated repository of verified apps.
! It has a non-piracy policy and does not host paid content.

$boost=2,site=github.com
! GitHub is intented to host code, so GitHub apps are usually opensource.
! Anyways, you should always double check what you are going to download.

$boost=2,site=gitlab.com
! GitLab works like GitHub, so same criteria applies for that service.

! These are unique opensource apps promoted by the Goggle:
